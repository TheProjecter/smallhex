Hi ^^
I'm Xeeynamo and I want to present you my first important project called smallHex!
smallHex is an Hex Editor for x86 PCs, and it works on Windows Operating system. It's based on ASCII graphics (Like DOS O.S) but is very simple to use! You can write on file in Hex Edit Mode or in Char Edit Mode, you can scroll, you can see Hex/Char, only Hex Code or only Char correspondence, copy and paste, to go to an offset of file and create patchs!
Oh, if you test this software or see the source code, you can write a feedback :).


Future plans:
> - Search Mode
> - Mini Explorer
> - DOS port
> - Playstation Portable Port (http://forums.qj.net/psp-development-forum/145571-release-smallhex-1-4-a.html)
